Now granted, there are some parts of math that.. aren't that fun. Geometry, angles, SOHCAHTOA.. they're boring for me. If you find them fun, consider yourself lucky - you can enjoy that part. But the other stuff, like algebra, calculus and all -- they aren't bad at all! Algebra involves manipulation of the equation to get in into a way in which you can solve it and find the value of x which fits. Calculus is the study of change, for example, what is change in distance with respect to time? Velocity. What is the change in velocity with respect to time? Acceleration. What is the change in ACCELERATION with respect to time? Jerk. And so on and so forth. This is differentiation! And this is the stuff I LOVE about math!
