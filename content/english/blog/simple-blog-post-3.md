Sometimes life can just suck. Like today is Halloween. I'd gone out trick-or-treating with my friends. The first house we got to, the owner completely dumped ALL the chocolates, meant for everyone, into MY bag. I split, giving each person three, because they kept pestering me for it. Even after that, they kept accusing me of hogging all the chocolates, and I kept hearing whispers of "Let's leave him behind" and all that stuff. The final straw: we finished up early and went to someone's house. She PARTICULARLY hates me, and made sure to give me the wrong timing to watch a horror movie at her house (45 minutes late) and said "BYE!" super happily and weirdly to me only. All the others caught on, one even telling me that he was sorry. The others gave me the same "BYE!" treatment and one pretended not to know (or maybe he genuinely didn't and I'm being overly paranoid). I'm super annoyed when I walk home and my mom can immediately tell that something is wrong. When she asks, I brushed it off, and said something stupid. She's really mad now, and so is everyone else in my house, and I don't know what to do.
